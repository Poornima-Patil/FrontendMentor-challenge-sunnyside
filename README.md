## My process
        I tried to approach the website by building desktop version first and then added media queries to ensure it works across mobile devices. Have mostly used flex hence it was simple to make it work on mobile devices.Also, wanted just to gain better knowlegde built this website with plain CSS, HTML and JS and tried not to use any of the frameworks.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

      Since I extensively used CSS flex, learnt lot of new approaches specifically while coding the header section.
      
### Continued development

Wanted to learn better approaches specifically for coding the navbar without using bootstrap. For the current project have applied some brute force way of coding the navbar and felt there could be better ways of doing it.


### Useful resources

         Got stuck at multiple levels specifically with the header(hero image part) and found solutions on stack overflow.
